## I only followed raw rect

I have tried to demostrate my solid understanding of react js application and implement proper best practices as much as I can.

## The API Integration

API integration and state management has been handled with the help of context API. A similar store pattern has been followed like redux but only in react way.

> NOTE: I know there are opportunities for caching mechanism in the task. I still choose to keep things simple. `useQuery` library can be utlised to implment advanced caching mechanism.

## Tests

Simplly run `yarn test` to run the behavioral tests.
